<h1>Official Junkyard Joust Wiki</h1>
<p>This is the official Junkyard Joust Wiki. The Junkyard Joust is a YouTube series created and narrated by Aaron Yonda. Among several event formats, the guiding rule is elimination of cars that can remain upright after randomly descending a steep track. This is often in a team-based format, generally with 5 cars on each team and often 5 or 7 teams per event. Cars are often modified with weight and sometimes crazier devices. Features custom tournaments as well as the main Junkyard Joust, which showcases 30-50 “standard” teams in a bracket-style elimination series managed by Yonda. Among others, weekly episodes have included snow races, themed races, and an Apocalypse series, which featured Apocalypse-themed submissions from 30+ fans of the channel.</p>
